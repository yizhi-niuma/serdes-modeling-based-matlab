# Decisions

## 2026-08-12: Repository organization

- Reusable models belong in `src/`.
- Behavioral and visual studies belong in `validation/`.
- Automated regression tests belong in `tests/`.
- Fixed input/reference data belongs in `data/`.
- Generated output belongs in `results/`.
- Project paths must resolve from `D:\Work\serdes_modeling`, not a former absolute location.

## 2026-08-13: Current documentation scope

- The current modeling baseline is derived only from `src/ADC` and `src/CDR`.
- `src/LinkSim` is retained as historical reference and must not be presented as the current architecture, current end-to-end implementation, or validated capability.
- Documentation claims must distinguish implemented component behavior from future closed-loop integration.

## 2026-08-13: Current ADC integration path

- `src/ADC/TI_ADC/sar_adc_core.m`, `ti_adc_core.m`, `ti_adc_clock.m`, and `ti_adc_top.m` form the current integrated TI ADC stack.
- Other SAR implementations remain comparison/reference models until an explicit consolidation decision is made.

## Observed model choices pending confirmation

The following values appear in current ADC waveform studies but are not yet permanent project-wide requirements:

- 112 Gb/s PAM4 and 56 GBd.
- 128 samples/UI.
- 64 TI ADC lanes and 8 SAR lanes per TAH group.
- 7-bit conversion.
- Maximum-power/variance phase selection for offline waveform sampling.
- Integer sample-index timing displacement.

## Pending decisions

- Canonical SAR code-boundary and reconstructed-voltage convention.
- Target CDR architecture and loop-filter type/order.
- CDR update cadence relative to data/edge sampling and TI ADC block conversion.
- Whether PI floating indices will be rounded or used with interpolation.
- Required jitter model composition and units at each block boundary.
- Accuracy/correlation target and numerical regression tolerances.
- Whether large waveform fixtures and generated results should remain version-controlled.
